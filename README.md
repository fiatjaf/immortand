# Client for Lightning-compatible Lite Channels aka "Hosted"

This is an amazing piece of software, still work-in-progress, based on [IMMORTAN](https://github.com/fiatjaf/immortan), that can do Lightning things, it is a "lite node", as we may call.

## Running

Grab a jar from the [releases page](https://github.com/fiatjaf/cliche/releases) and run it with `java -jar cliche.jar`. This will use `~/.config/cliche` as your data directory and create a SQLite database there.

To use a different directory do `java -Dcliche.datadir=/my/other/directory -jar cliche.jar`.

In that directory you can have a file called `cliche.conf` that can have the same options that we have specified on [reference.conf](https://github.com/fiatjaf/cliche/blob/master/src/main/resources/reference.conf). The settings will default to the ones on `reference.conf`. You can also specify the settings as flags like the `cliche.datadir` above and these will take precedence even over `cliche.conf`.

### Running the native image (no JVM required)

Download the native image from the [releases page](https://github.com/fiatjaf/cliche/releases), call `chmod +x` on it and run it with `./cliche`. All the rest is the same as above except it doesn't require a Java Virtual Machine at all (also starts much faster and who knows, maybe it's faster and leaner too but that remains to be proven).

To pass options just do `./cliche -Dcliche.datadir=etc`.

## Usage

`cliche` can be used either via direct communication via STDIN with responses via STDOUT or through a websocket (that is hardcoded to listen at `ws://127.0.0.1:12000`). Both interfaces accept either CLI-style commands or JSON-RPC.

This is an example session with some commands called and asynchronous events being received:

```
~> ./cliche
# initial parameters
# configs: network=mainnet json.compact=false
# setting up database
# setting up pathfinder
# instantiating channel master
# instantiating electrum actors
# loading onchain wallets
# start electrum, fee rate listener
# is operational: true
# listening for outgoing payments
# listening for incoming payments
# waiting for commands

  }
}
```

The same methods can be called either with this CLI-like format or with JSON-RPC, like

```json
{"id":"x","method":"create-invoice","params":{"msatoshi":164000}}
```

## Casual Usage

For casual usage you'll want the CLI-style commands format, so you can just type `create-invoice --msatoshi 100000 --description test`, for example, and get a response in your terminal.

- The STDIN/STDOUT interface works best if you're just running `cliche` in a terminal. In that case you can just use that same terminal window to execute commands.
- If you have [`rlwrap`](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) (probably installable from your Linux default package manager) use it for a much better experience. Start `cliche` with `rlwrap cliche {...args}` and your life will be much better.
- The websocket interface works fine too, specially if `cliche` is running as a service or as a subprocess somewhere else, in that case you can use a CLI tool like [`websocat`](https://github.com/vi/websocat), call `websocat ws://127.0.0.1:12000` then start typing commands.

## Programmatic Usage

For programmatic usage you'll want the JSON-RPC format so you can distinguish responses by their JSON-RPC ids.

- The STDIN/STDOUT interface can be used if a different program (i.e. your Lightning-powered application) actually starts `cliche` as a subprocess, then proceeds to write commands to its STDIN and listen to its STDOUT for responses and event notifications. See [go-cliche](https://github.com/fiatjaf/go-cliche) for a library that does that.
- The websocket interface can be used too if `cliche` is running as a standalone service -- for example, by systemd, or inside a container. In that case your application just needs to open a websocket connection to `ws://127.0.0.1` and start sending commands and listening for responses and event notifications.

This is intended to be started by a different program and methods to be called by sending data over STDIN and responses from STDOUT.

## API

### Methods

- `get-info`, params: none
- `request-hc`, params: `pubkey` (string), `host` (string), `port` (number), `label` (string, optional), `secret` (hex string, optional)
- `remove-hc`, params: `channel-id` (string)
- `create-invoice`, params: `msatoshi` (number, optional), `description` (string, optional), `description_hash` (hex string, optional), `preimage` (string, optional)
- `pay-invoice`, params: `invoice` (string), `msatoshi` (number, optional)
- `pay-lnurl`, params: `lnurl` (string, accepts LUD-01, LUD-16 and LUD-17 formats), `msatoshi`, (number, required), `comment` (string, optional, for LUD-12), `name` (string, optional, for LUD-18), `attach-auth` (boolean, defaults to true, for LUD-18)
- `check-payment` (works for both incoming and outgoing payments), params: `hash` (hex string)
- `list-payments`, params: `count` (optional, int)
- `accept-override`, params: `channel-id` (string)
- `get-address`, params: none

### Notifications

- `ready` (emitted once when `cliche` is ready to answer commands)
- `payment_succeeded` (emitted on every outgoing payment success)
- `payment_failed` (emitted on every outgoing payment complete failure -- no more attempts or pending shards)
- `payment_received` (emitted on every committed incoming payment)
- `lnurlpay_params` (emitted upon lnurl-pay params are receiving during a `pay-lnurl` call)
- `lnurlpay_success` (emitted after a `pay-lnurl` payment is completed, may contain a LUD-09/LUD-10 `successAction`)

## Building and development

For development you can just do `sbt run`, and to compile a fat jar that later can be run with just `java -jar` do `sbt assembly`.

If your `build.sbt` happen to have an Immortan version ending with `-SNAPSHOT` that means you either have to build Immortan and publish it locally using that version (`sbt publishLocal` on Immortan repository) or you can change to a non-snapshot version. Pick one from [here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fiatjaf/immortan_2.13/).

### Building the GraalVM Native Image

1. Download GraalVM 22.0.0.3, here I used java11-linux version from [release 22.0.0.3](https://github.com/gluonhq/graal/releases/tag/gluon-22.0.0.3-Final);
2. Set the environment variable `GRAALVM_HOME` to the directory where you unzipped that;
3. Run `sbt nativeImage`.

(If something big changes then it might be necessary to run the native image agent again. In that case it might be wise to edit the `Main.scala` block guarded by the `if (Config.nativeImageAgent)` condition to make sure the most important codepaths are touched during the agent run, then run `sbt nativeImageRunAgent` and then `sbt nativeImage`.)

## Uses

This is a list of projects using `cliche`:

  - [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/blob/4ad3c841528de3efafefe48f667e6800eb7074e3/lnbits/wallets/cliche.py), a multipurpose extensible web Lightning Wallet provider
  - [@lntxbot](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lntxbot), a Telegram bot that does Lightning tips and payments
  - [relampago](https://github.com/lnbits/relampago), a Golang library for talking to any kind of Lightning backend
